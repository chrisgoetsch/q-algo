## ðŸ§  Purpose

This file defines how QThink processes mesh agent signals, macro overlays, volatility context, alignment, and learned reinforcement weights to generate a final trade score.

The score is used to determine the confidence of SPY 0DTE entry or exit and is recorded for learning, journaling, and model refinement.

## ðŸ§® Core Signal Equation (V2 â€“ Production Grade)

QThink computes its `adjusted_score` for any trade opportunity using the following multi-factor model:

```text
raw_score = âˆ‘ (agent_score Ã— agent_weight Ã— context_multiplier Ã— reinforcement_weight)

adjusted_score = raw_score Ã— alignment_coefficient Ã— conviction_multiplier - penalty_factor
